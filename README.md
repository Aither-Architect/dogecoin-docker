# DogecoinD Docker Image

## ALPHA RELEASE !!!
While there's enough information around the web to get started running a Dogecoin FullNode, there isn't any central documentation for ongoing operations and maintenance of a Doge server. This repo along with dogecoin-helm aim to fill that gap over time.

## Testing
Automated Helm-based tests are on the roadmap in order to scale development/support across K8s platforms/distros (EKS Support is next) For now this has been tested on a DigitalOcean Kubernetes 1.20 cluster as that's the lowest barrier of entry i've found into the k8s arena and we want this in as many hands as possible.

## CONTRIBUTING
Pull Requests are welcome! It's as simple as that for now.
